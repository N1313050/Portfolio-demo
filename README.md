# General Information-
Greeting, I hope you are having a fantastic day, I am Alexey Ovsyanik , currently a student at Nottingham Trent University , doing my first year in the course of data science , I have a certificate of completion from A Belarusian High school and Abbey college  both for IFP and GSCE, and last time I completed IElTS for the  application to these university I had a grade 8. As a interesting fact about me I would like to inform you that I enjoy learning about history , collecting medieval weapons and armour even as replicas , reading and play tabletop games, such as Warhammer 40k tenth edition and Magic the gathering as well as DnD, all thing that have taught me collaboration skills and improvisation, at university I attend the fencing club, those I have not yet found time for it I would like to go back to Horse ridding, a hobby that teaches you to pay attention to your surroundings patience and care.

# Future careers  
My future career aspiration .
Business Intelligence Analyst- a close friend of mine plans to start a business after he graduates and complete military serving in his country god be willing I would like to help him in his a business opportunity 
Data Engineer- another one of potential carers as the job description and so far what I have found online make a job a would enjoy and as it says, a job you enjoy is no job at all, so in fact I will remain unemployed to that wisdom .

And finally my third career choice, Statistician- for probabilities always fascinated me.


# Analysis of Own Skills  
During these year at university I have developed the following skill set . 
In Fundamentals of data science I have have learned and master how to use SSPc statistics, I have a strong background in data analysis and statistical reasoning. During the Fundamentals of Data Science course I enrolled in, I also did hands-on application of SPSS to conduct the statistical analysis necessary for this course. I learned to analyze, and summarize complex datasets as I was able to develop foundational knowledge in probability theory, sampling designs, and descriptive statistics. I also learned how to carry out hypothesis tests, simple linear regression, and analysis of variance (ANOVA), allowing me to glean appropriate conclusions from the data, and make informed data-based decisions. Each of these skills were further supported by practicals using real datasets; which allowed them to also develop technical skills and gain analytical abilities. I am confident I can engage with data-related problems systematically and report out my findings in a clear and concise manner.

For System Analysis and Design course, I didn't have an opportunity to go through the first part of the second term due to some health difficulties. Because of this, I felt it best to turn a negative into a positive and engage in an independent study of the missed content. I learned a great deal about the primary theoretical topics around: SDLC approaches, project planning, requirement analysis, functional modelling, structural modeling, data design, user interface design, program design, and architectural design. While I didn't have the ability to directly participate in hands-on learning through the course, I was glad to be engaged with the content through independent learning. I feel like I made a solid foundation of knowledge related to system development concepts. I am now comfortable in applying my theoretical knowledge into practice and demonstrating value in systems' design and implementation in future practice.
Programming for Data Science was the first time I had encountered Python so it took me a while to become comfortable with how everything works. As I worked through the material, I developed a very basic understanding of how Python is structured and how it is used in data science work. I was particularly interested in what I learned about data libraries like NumPy and pandas. They were examples of ways that data can be stored, arranged, and analyzed in powerful ways. Using these data libraries gave me the opportunity to practice using real datasets and helped me have a better understanding of how coding supports data analysis step-wise. I went from no experience with Python to feeling confident in writing the simplest level of code in Python and being able to work in Python to perform a data task at a basic level. This course gave me a strong foundation to build from, and I look forward to continuing to learn and build my skills.

As for Prof devovelempt of in dustry i have  learned the developemtn progress for sites, and how data analsysiis is used ion projects
